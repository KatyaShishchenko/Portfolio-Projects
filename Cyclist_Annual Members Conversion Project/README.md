README: Converting Casual Riders Into Annual Members for Cyclistic 


Overview

The goal of this project was to analyze usage patterns between casual riders and annual members at Cyclistic, a bicycle rental company, to develop a data-driven marketing strategy for converting casual riders into annual members. The analysis examined customer behavior data from Q1 2019, identifying key differences in how these two user segments utilize Cyclistic's bike-sharing services. The study provides actionable insights and recommendations to support the marketing team's efforts to increase annual memberships and boost company revenue.


Business Understanding

Cyclistic's finance analysts have determined that annual members are significantly more profitable than casual riders. While flexible pricing attracts casual users, converting them to annual memberships represents a key growth opportunity. Rather than targeting entirely new customers, the marketing team aims to leverage existing casual rider familiarity with the Cyclistic brand and service.
This project addresses a critical business question: How do casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic differently?
